Superperson 2

This project is the second version of a Java project intended to teach vital
Java skills. The first was a bit basic, limited, and broken, so version 2
is a complete re-write. As such, it is still a work in progress. The front end
will become gradually more capable after basic functionality is established.

The project itself is a web application designed for reporting sightings of
superheroes (or supervillians), and as such, it has the capacity to track and
relate a great deal of information. This capacity will only grow as the app is
finished and refined.
